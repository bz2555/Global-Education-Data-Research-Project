Title: Globle education data research project

# 2. Project Abstract
This project investigates **global education disparities** using a dataset of 200+ countries and regions, which includes 29 variables covering indicators such as school enrollment, out-of-school rates disaggregated by gender, literacy rates, and transition rates across different educational stages. The dataset allows us to explore how **educational access and attainment vary globally**, with a particular focus on **gender differences** and **regional inequalities**. For example, the dataset captures the percentage of boys and girls who are out of school at pre-primary, primary, and lower secondary levels, as well as adult and youth literacy levels, providing a rich foundation for analyzing education systems across diverse contexts.
# 3. Dataset Overview and Features
## 3.1 Data Format
The dataset is stored as an Excel file (.xlsx) with two sheets:  
- GlobalEducationData: Contains the raw numerical indicators for each country/region.
- Data Dictionary: Provides definitions and descriptions for all 29 variables, ensuring consistent interpretation.
## 3.2 Global Education Data
To explore worldwide educational access and equity, this project uses a dataset that covers over 200 countries and regions. The dataset includes 29 variables representing indicators of school enrollment, out-of-school rates, literacy rates, and educational transitions. These measures are disaggregated by education stage (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary, upper secondary) and, where applicable, by gender (male/female).
- Geographic Information: Latitude and longitude coordinates to enable regional or spatial comparisons.
- Education Access Indicators: Out-of-school rates for children and adolescents at different educational stages.
- Enrollment and Completion Rates: Gross enrollment ratios and transition rates between education levels.
- Literacy Indicators: Youth and adult literacy rates that reflect longer-term educational outcomes.
- Equity Measures: Gender parity indices and gender-disaggregated statistics to evaluate differences between boys and girls.
